The Assignment:
You will implement and test the sequence class using an array to store the sequence's items.

Purposes:
Ensure that you can write a small class that uses an array as a private member variable.
Familiarize yourself with the sequence container class (which may also be part of future assignments).
Give us a chance to evaluate your programming skills on a small class.

Before Starting:
Read all of Chapter 3.

Files that you must write and turn in:
1.	sequence1.h: The header file for the sequence class. Actually, you don't have to write much of this file. Decide on appropriate private member variables, 
and declare these in the sequence class definition at the bottom of the header file. If some of your member functions are implemented as inline functions, then 
you may put those implementations in this file too. 
2.	sequence1.cpp: The implementation file for this first sequence class. You will write all of this file, which will have the implementations of all the sequence's 
member functions. 

Other files that you may find helpful:
1.	sequence_test.cpp: A simple interactive test program. 
2.	sequence_exam.cpp: A non-interactive test program that will be used to grade the correctness of your sequence class.
