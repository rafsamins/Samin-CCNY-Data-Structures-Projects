The Assignment: 
You will implement and test a small class called statistician, which is similar to some of the small classes in Chapter 2 of the text. 

Purposes: 
Ensure that you can write a small class that meets a precise specification. 
Make sure you understand how to write a class that is separated into a header file and an implementation file. 
Give you experience in using a test program to track down bugs in a class's implementation. 

Before Starting: 
Read all of Chapter 2. 
Know how to compile and run C++ programs on your system. 

How to Turn In: 
Show your source files and the output of running statexam.cpp in class.

Files that you must write: 
1.	stats.h: The header file for the new statistician class. You don't have to write much of this file. If some of your member functions are 
implemented as inline functions, then you may put those implementations in this file too. 
2.	stats.cpp: The implementation file for the new statistician class. You will write all of this file, which will have the implementations 
of all the statistician's member functions. 

Other files that you may find helpful: 
    You shall compile one of the following files with your stats.cpp and link them to generate your executable: 
1.	stattest.cpp: A simple interactive test program for you to test your implementations. 
2.	statexam.cpp: A non-interactive test program that will be used to grade the correctness of your statistician class.
